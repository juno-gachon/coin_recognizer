Discover the coins by detecting the circle in the picture and classify them into 500won, 100won, 50won, and 10won according to the radius of the coin. Print the values of the coins the user has classified on top of the picture so that the user knows how much the coins are, depending on their size. (To be written further when implementing additional features)
